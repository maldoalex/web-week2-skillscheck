          Some people spend their whole lives striving for perfection. For “Mr.
          Perfect” Curt Hennig, it’s what came natural. A flawless technician
          with a flair for the dramatic, Mr. Perfect did everything — you
          guessed it — perfectly. His dropkicks were textbook, his Perfectplex
          was near inescapable. He brought the Intercontinental Title a new
          level of credibility during his two reigns and set a higher standard
          for technical wrestling in WWE when he defended the championship
          against Bret “Hit Man” Hart at SummerSlam 1991. In his prime, the man
          was the pinnacle of a sports-entertainer from his curly blonde hair
          right down to his spotless white boots.</card
